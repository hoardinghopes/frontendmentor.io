## My process

1. Create HTML structure
2. Add supplied styles (typographic)
3. Use Firefox Developer Tools to add layout styles
4. Built on desktop first, checked mobile after

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

First time around, I used `<figure>` to hold the QR code, but it had no associated `<figcaption>` so that didn't seem right.
After [a bit of reading](https://html.com/images/#Picture_Element), I decided to fall back to an `<img>` tag.
